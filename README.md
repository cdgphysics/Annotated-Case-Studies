# Annotated Case Studies
A collection of annotated evaluated case studies (Notebook) using visualizations and statistical inferences along with predictive modeling and analytics such as linear regression, classification models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, bagging, adaboost, ensemble classifiers) and clustering.

### Clustering Bank Customers - [Notebook](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/Bank_Customer_Loan.ipynb) - [Dataset](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/Loan_Customers.csv)
* To create optimal number of clusters for the bank customers, describe how each cluster differs from others, and suggest business insights for the bank

### Walmart Sales Forecast - [Notebook](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/busi_650_project.ipynb) - [Summary Report](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/Team%20Project_Walmart%20Report.pdf) - [Datasets](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/tree/master/Walmart%20Data)
* Using the static features of a store and department with dynamic regional conditions such as temperature, consumer price index, fuel price and unemployment rate, determine if a department of a given store for a given week should be "downsized" BEFORE the store opens for that given week.

### German Credit Risk - [Notebook](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/German_Credit_Risk.ipynb) - [Dataset](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/German_Credit.csv)
* To help a bank make a decision on whether to approve a loan to a prospective applicant based on their financial, demographic and socio-economic profiles

### US Honey Production - [Notebook](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/Honey_Case_CGriffith.ipynb) - [Dataset](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/honeyproduction1998-2016.csv)
* To visualize how honey production has changed over the years (1998-2016) in the United States.

### Loan Delinquency - [Notebook](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/Loan_Study.ipynb) - [Dataset](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/Loan_Delinquent_Dataset.csv)
* To identify the criteria to approve loans for an individual customer such that the likelihood of the loan delinquency is minimized.

### Netherlands Toyota Corollas - [Notebook](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/Toyota_Case_CGriffith.ipynb) - [Dataset](https://github.com/cdgphysics/Case-Studies/blob/master/ToyotaCorolla.csv)
* The file ToyotaCorolla.csv contains data on used cars (Toyota Corolla) on sale during late summer of 2004 in the Netherlands. It has 1436 records containing details on 38 attributes, including Price, Age, Kilometers, HP, and other specifications. The goal is to predict the price of a used Toyota Corolla based on its specifications.
